Greg taught my SWC instructor training course via teleconference in 2015. Even
though I met him through a screen his ability to convey what it is to really
teach, and the passion by which he conveyed his message really stuck with me.
I've carried that on through my postdoc, and I just wanted to say thank you
Greg.

I was inspired by your drive to do what you thought was best and right in your
career (University of Toronto) and due to human factors (Mozilla Science Lab)
at work. Seeing professional integrity in action is different than reading it
from a book. Also, I won't forget your railing against too many workshops
covering the same ground at the Software Credit Workshop
(www.software.ac.uk/software-credit) while highlighting your research around
teaching software skills being the only sustainable approach to improve
practice; I liked the combination of critique and imparting actionable
knowledge. I still don't know why you hate Git so much, but if there is a blog
post about this, then do send me the link, I am sure it's well founded  :  D  -
All the best in your future endeavours and to your family!

Greg, the instructor training changed my life. At least the part of it spent

how much Software Carpentry changed the way we can immerse ourselves in
computing. Thank you!

When I first started instructor training I was nervous, since most of my
interactions with people who code hadn't been positive. Greg's warmth, care and
welcoming attitude quickly endeared me to him and the whole carpentry
community. He took an interest in me as a person and has been a huge
inspiration to me on how to approach science, teaching, and life.

I first met Greg during the 2014 Software Carpentry Instructor Training he held
online. I was a stay at home dad at the time and split my time between work
projects and watching my newborn son, Nova. Often I would have to attend
the SWC training sessions with my son napping in his baby carrier strapped
to my chest. Nova slept pretty well, and I tried to make judicious use of
the mute button so the session wasn't filled with baby noises. 

Greg, as a father himself, not only tolerated my son being in class with
me, but even seemed happy that he was there. Sometimes Greg also had to
teach with his daughter in tow if she was home ill. It was good for me to
see Greg model how being a scientist and active leader can mesh with the
other important roles in our lives. 

Thanks for all your hard work Greg, and best of luck in your future endeavors!

in tow. I couldn't find a good picture of me and Nova at a SWC session, either
remote or in-person]

Greg's sense of mission, his commitment to the importance of readability and
reproducibility in scientific software, were hugely important to my focus and
confidence in contributing to the Research Software Engineering movement in the
UK. His advice and support have been important on many occasions in the story
of the UCL research software group.

I remember at Sci Py going swimming at Barton Springs Pool with a number of
research software heros, including Greg and Fernando Perez. One of those weird
moments when you find yourself socialising at a peer level with people who were
once legends! I've been an admirer of Greg's at least since \title{Beautiful
Code}.

Another moment characteristic of Greg's considerateness: I remember Greg moving
aside to the other room when we taught carpentry together the first time in
Greenwich: to make sure my teaching wasn't worsened by being starstruck! A big
vote of confidence that meant a lot.

The first time I met Greg was at UC Berkeley. I was struck by his warmth and
openness. I was a stranger, and he had a busy schedule, and yet he took the
time to sit down with me and have a genuine conversation about SC, pedagogy,
and the future of the classroom. It was at that time that I knew SC was the
right community for me.

The Software Carpentry instructor training which I was fortunate to participate
in 2014 has not only profoundly changed the way I prepare and deliver courses
but also changed my career path towards teaching software development tools and
techniques. I still remember every anecdote that Greg has shared with us during
the training. When I prepare new material, I automatically analyze the new
material with Greg's words of advice resonating in my head. Thanks to Greg I
have embraced the importance of exercises and interaction and the importance to
simplify and distill the essence of a course and always mind the cognitive
load. I am very grateful for this experience and wish you all the best for the
future!

Now, I am working at one of the president candidates camp as a data scientist.

After the instructor training, several of us learners took the bus back with
Greg to Berkeley's campus. Greg was trying to find his way to his next meeting
(at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science); I offered to walk him there. We
got off the bus and approached the streetcorner. The light was red, but I began
walking, motioning for Greg to follow. He wouldn't budge. I turned back,
waiting with him until the light was green. He looked at me and said, ``There's
a fundamental shift in the way you live when you're responsible for someone
else's life. If I had broken my leg just now, who would take care of my
mother?''

Of course this is poorly quoted, but I will remember that lesson most of all.
Thank you, Greg. You are one of my heroes.

My first SWC workshop (bootcamp at the time) teaching experience was a
disaster.  Greg through me into discussing python lists, on what I felt like
was a bit of a whim.  I was totally unprepared and it showed!  I remember
talking to Greg about quitting my teaching ambitions.  After several kind words
of encouragement, his therapy was to make me teach half the next day instead,
it was still pretty disastrous but Greg kept inviting me to teach with him.
And it did get better...so much so that I do it for a living now.  I'll always
remember Greg's discussion on triumph and think of it often on bad teaching
days.

Greg Wilson's influence has filtered so deeply into my approach to teaching and
science communication that it is hard to name.  It reminds me of the fish that
does not know it is wet.  Books that his Software Carpentry Train-the-trainers
led me to are now the foundation for my approach to teaching.  I just finished
reading a treatise on standup comedy that I must have heard about from him.
This Thursday I'll teach the second half of the Software Carpentry Python
module, and to prepare I ask myself ``what did Greg do?'' Thank you for your
influential work!

While I've always appreciated the time Greg has made for face-to-skype time and

I came all the way to Montreal for one of the very first SWC workshops aimed at
librarians that you put together, prompted by a tweet and not much thinking.
Within minutes of watching you teach, I knew there was something special there.
You were demystifying something without dumbing it down, with an intense
respect for learners. This made me question most of what I thought about
teaching tech, unlearn what I thought I knew. I'm very fortunate I was able to
complete instructor training with you and I hope I am now approaching all
instances in which I have to teach something to someone with the care and
respect you taught me. Live long and prosper.

When I first met you in East Lansing, you told me that I was ``bright but
unfocused.''  You definitely weren't wrong, and I definitely was very annoyed!
Alas, that Software Carpentry workshop and my want to prove that I could be
focused led me down an unexpected path of becoming a software developer.  I
absolutely love it, and I love teaching it to others.  I couldn't have found
myself so truly if it weren't for you, and I'm forever grateful.

I learnt a very valuable lesson about teaching when you lead an SWC workshop in
my first year at Columbia.  You masterfully re-directed my smart-ass energy by
foretelling that I would become an instructor. You also gave me a phrase which

since: ``Do you want your results to be correct, or just plausible?'' Thank
you!

I met Greg at  a conference in Chicago back in 2012. He was already a legend
and I was apprehensive - what could I do to help him with his mission? As part
of the Software Sustainability Institute, we were already working with Software
Carpentry. He was so inspirational, with such clarity of vision and passion. He
preached. I was blown away.  Meeting with Greg was like meeting with a force of
nature. From then on I was kind of working for him - helping set up SC across
the EU Life Science community through the ELIXIR programme and brokering
sponsorship deals and just doing my best  to promote SC. At a train the
trainers workshop in Manchester late 2015, I had the pleasure of seeing him in
action - handing on the wisdom. He challenged lazy thinking and easy practices,
and showed alternatives. Greg, you are one of the people who I can genuinely
say changed me. May you continue onwards and upwards.

If you throw a dart at a globe and hit land, you'll find one of Greg's friends.
If you travel there, you can expect an introduction. He wants his friends to be
friends: that's how he builds a community.

Greg Wilson was the sixth person I met by name in Toronto. He gave me a job
(yep, paid!) TAing for Software Carpentry and building content back when it was
a full semester class and we were producing PowerPoint+video lectures. What
struck me about Greg was his ability to maintain a mission and iterate until he
found the right community. Occasionally, when we were out of money and unsure
where we would get more, the whole thing felt a little Quixotic. Somehow Greg
would mine his legendary breadth of contacts, sell the right people on his
passionately held beliefs, and try again with a new iteration. 

Today, Software Carpentry's global scale, the hundreds of volunteers, the
thousands of students are all the offshoot of a passionate, dogged pursuit of
Greg's original mission to build a community of educators and scientists.

Hi, Greg! I'd like to thank you for all your work at Software Carpentry. Thanks

that matters, is used and makes difference. Thank you once again and good luck

The workshop I took from Greg in 2012 was billed as a ``python bootcamp,'' but
it was so much more than that.  It revolutionized how I use computers and how I
think about my day-to-day practice of science.  Five years later, I'm still
learning new things from my memories of what he said.  Having taught a couple
SWC sessions myself recently, I'm also in awe of how efficient he was as a
teacher...  if only my examples and anecdotes were half as memorable as his.

Greg, although we only met for a short period in person, you have had a huge
impact on the way that I approach teaching.  I thoroughly enjoyed your stories
during instructor training and really appreciated your opinions when you
visited the University of Michigan in 2016.  If I can express, both for my
research area and teaching, only half of the energy and passion that you have I
will consider myself a success.  Good luck with your future endeavors, you will
most definitely be missed and hard to replace within the Software Carpentry
ecosystem.

I discovered Greg quite by accident in the form of his 2006 presentation at
Purdue university (https://nanohub.org/resources/1811).  I can't remember
exactly what year it was and what series of searches and hyperlinks caused me
to land there, but my approach to research has not been the same since.  I
immediately showed the video to my research group, did a one day in-service to
begin training them with the few relevant skills that I had.  This ultimately
inspired The Hacker Within [THW], my students started to train me, and it all
came full circle when THW invited Greg to visit Madison, WI, as the keynote for
our first Software Carpentry Workshop in January 2011. Six years later,
Software Carpentry lessons are required reading when joining my group, many of
my students become trained instructors, and our campus trains about 150
learners a year in regular Carpentry workshops.  Greg has left an indelible
mark on me, those who pass through my group, and my research.

Greg you are special to me. I was a new comer to Software Carpentry when I met

do my teaching demo. Everything was scary to me at that time, but you walked me
through each step patiently successfully. I was the happiest girl when you

The first time I took a Train the Trainers course with Greg I was struck by his
enthusiasm for pedagogy. After contributing to SWC online materials, teaching
my first workshop, and helping out with other workshops, I helped out with
another Train the Trainers session. The learners in that session were
captivated by Greg's instruction, just as I was the first time witnessing his
instruction, as evident from the sticky note feedback after the workshop. I
feel lucky to have worked with Greg, and I look forward to continuing
involvement with this great organization that he has built.

During the morning coffee break at the first workshop I ever taught with Greg
he was chatting with some of the students who told him they were interested in
seeing reproducible data analysis in action. At the end of the break he tracks
me down and says ``Hey Ethan, can you do a quick demonstration of some data
analysis in an IPython Notebook if I end 30 minutes early?''. I told him I
didn't have anything prepared, but he told me that whatever I pulled together
in the next hour would be fine, and ran off to teach before I could say no. So,
I sat in the back of the room, sketched something out, gave a live demo of it
without practicing, and it was a huge hit.

This experience taught me that I was capable of using live unrehersed coding as
a teaching technique and that it would be a very powerful one in the right
circumstances. I now regularly use this technique in cases where students want
to learn more about something I haven't planned to cover. I would have never
had the confidence to do this without being pushed into it and my students
regularly say that those sections end up being some of the most valuable
portions of the course. I suspect a lot of folks have similar stories of Greg
pushing them out of their comfort zones in a way that made them better teachers
and scholars. Thanks Greg.

Three stone masons were working on a cathedral when someone asked them what

\item ``I am laying bricks'' said the first.
\item ``I am building a wall'' said the second.
\item The third one answered: ``I am constructing the house of God''.

{\LARGE Technical Details}

The basic template for this book was put together by Eric Jeschke in
2009, as part of a ``Solo Photo Book Month'' project.  The original book
is titled \title{Chickens, Anyone?} and is a lovely recounting of his
family's adventures with raising chickens in their back yard.  The template
was pointed out to me (Erik) by Jonah Duckles, and by complete coincidence
I am personally acquainted with Eric Jeschke, and knowing of his talent I
immediately decided to adopt his work as my template, as he has made it
freely available for copying:

https://redskiesatnight.com/books/pod/latex-templates-for-pod-publishing-with-blurb-com

You'll note that much of the layout of the book was inspired by his book,
so credit where credit is due.

I did what I could with photos taken off the web, and some sent to me by
individual respondents.  Many of them will not be,
perfectionalistically-speaking, `print-quality', but they'll have to do given
that this was done on short time.

The book is written using \LaTeX with {\em xetex} and {\em xdvipdfmx} for
easier adjustments for dead tree publishing.  The font used is EB Garamond.
The book was made on Cygwin, and files were tracked in (I'm sorry to say) a
{\em git} repository.  As we were short on time it did not follow many good
software development practices such as reuse or scripting of repetitive tasks
due in part to xkcd\#1319:
