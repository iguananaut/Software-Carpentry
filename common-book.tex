{\LARGE About this book}

Since the late 90's you (Greg) have been working tirelessly, through multiple
iterations and reboots, on advancing a singular (complex, multi-faceted) agenda
of potentially enormous (and previously underappreciated) real world impact.
In the time even before the scaling up of Software Carpentry you have reached
untold thousands of people.  But realizing the scale of the problem, and that
there was no way he could go it alone, you founded the Software Carpentry
Foundation, through which your mission could be spread above and beyond a
single person, and become a self-sustaining force for advancing the cause of
computation literacy in the scientific community, and the broader impacts
entailed by that.

You are now moving on to new opportunities, but the legacy you have created
will continue to be a force for good in the world, and for the hundreds of
people you've brought in to the Carpentry family.  You may be leaving the SWC
Foundation, but we know you'll still be involved in this cause, so this should
be read not as a ``goodbye'', but as a ``thank you''.

This book was created by soliciting the Software and Data Carpentry community
for any anecdotes and messages they have for you, and pairing them with photos
from Carpentry history.  The messages are listed in the order that they were
received, and are unedited except for some minor formatting.  Some of the
images were included along with the messages, and the rest were collected from
around the web.

Greg taught my SWC instructor training course via teleconference in 2015. Even
though I met him through a screen his ability to convey what it is to really
teach, and the passion by which he conveyed his message really stuck with me.
I've carried that on through my postdoc, and I just wanted to say thank you
Greg.

I was inspired by your drive to do what you thought was best and right in your
career (University of Toronto) and due to human factors (Mozilla Science Lab)
at work. Seeing professional integrity in action is different than reading it
from a book. Also, I won't forget your railing against too many workshops
covering the same ground at the Software Credit Workshop
(www.software.ac.uk/software-credit) while highlighting your research around
teaching software skills being the only sustainable approach to improve
practice; I liked the combination of critique and imparting actionable
knowledge. I still don't know why you hate Git so much, but if there is a blog
post about this, then do send me the link, I am sure it's well founded  :  D  -
All the best in your future endeavours and to your family!

I first met Greg during the 2014 Software Carpentry Instructor Training he held
online. I was a stay at home dad at the time and split my time between work
projects and watching my newborn son, Nova. Often I would have to attend
the SWC training sessions with my son napping in his baby carrier strapped
to my chest. Nova slept pretty well, and I tried to make judicious use of
the mute button so the session wasn't filled with baby noises. 

Greg, as a father himself, not only tolerated my son being in class with
me, but even seemed happy that he was there. Sometimes Greg also had to
teach with his daughter in tow if she was home ill. It was good for me to
see Greg model how being a scientist and active leader can mesh with the
other important roles in our lives. 

Thanks for all your hard work Greg, and best of luck in your future endeavors!

Greg's sense of mission, his commitment to the importance of readability and
reproducibility in scientific software, were hugely important to my focus and
confidence in contributing to the Research Software Engineering movement in the
UK. His advice and support have been important on many occasions in the story
of the UCL research software group.

I remember at Sci Py going swimming at Barton Springs Pool with a number of
research software heros, including Greg and Fernando Perez. One of those weird
moments when you find yourself socialising at a peer level with people who were
once legends! I've been an admirer of Greg's at least since \title{Beautiful
Code}.

Another moment characteristic of Greg's considerateness: I remember Greg moving
aside to the other room when we taught carpentry together the first time in
Greenwich: to make sure my teaching wasn't worsened by being starstruck! A big
vote of confidence that meant a lot.

in 2014 has not only profoundly changed the way I prepare and deliver courses
but also changed my career path towards teaching software development tools and

the training. When I prepare new material, I automatically analyze the new
material with Greg's words of advice resonating in my head. Thanks to Greg I

After the instructor training, several of us learners took the bus back with
Greg to Berkeley's campus. Greg was trying to find his way to his next meeting
(at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science); I offered to walk him there. We
got off the bus and approached the streetcorner. The light was red, but I began
walking, motioning for Greg to follow. He wouldn't budge. I turned back,
waiting with him until the light was green. He looked at me and said, ``There's
a fundamental shift in the way you live when you're responsible for someone
else's life. If I had broken my leg just now, who would take care of my

Of course this is poorly quoted, but I will remember that lesson most of all.

talking to Greg about quitting my teaching ambitions.  After several kind words
of encouragement, his therapy was to make me teach half the next day instead,
it was still pretty disastrous but Greg kept inviting me to teach with him.
And it did get better...so much so that I do it for a living now.  I'll always

I met Greg at  a conference in Chicago back in 2012. He was already a legend
and I was apprehensive - what could I do to help him with his mission? As part
of the Software Sustainability Institute, we were already working with Software
Carpentry. He was so inspirational, with such clarity of vision and passion. He
preached. I was blown away.  Meeting with Greg was like meeting with a force of
nature. From then on I was kind of working for him - helping set up SC across
the EU Life Science community through the ELIXIR programme and brokering
sponsorship deals and just doing my best  to promote SC. At a train the
trainers workshop in Manchester late 2015, I had the pleasure of seeing him in

If you throw a dart at a globe and hit land, you'll find one of Greg's friends.
If you travel there, you can expect an introduction. He wants his friends to be

Greg Wilson was the sixth person I met by name in Toronto. He gave me a job
(yep, paid!) TAing for Software Carpentry and building content back when it was
a full semester class and we were producing PowerPoint+video lectures. What
struck me about Greg was his ability to maintain a mission and iterate until he
found the right community. Occasionally, when we were out of money and unsure
where we would get more, the whole thing felt a little Quixotic. Somehow Greg
would mine his legendary breadth of contacts, sell the right people on his
passionately held beliefs, and try again with a new iteration. 

Today, Software Carpentry's global scale, the hundreds of volunteers, the
thousands of students are all the offshoot of a passionate, dogged pursuit of
Greg's original mission to build a community of educators and scientists.

Purdue university (https://nanohub.org/resources/1811).  I can't remember
exactly what year it was and what series of searches and hyperlinks caused me
to land there, but my approach to research has not been the same since.  I
immediately showed the video to my research group, did a one day in-service to
begin training them with the few relevant skills that I had.  This ultimately
inspired The Hacker Within [THW], my students started to train me, and it all
came full circle when THW invited Greg to visit Madison, WI, as the keynote for
our first Software Carpentry Workshop in January 2011. Six years later,
Software Carpentry lessons are required reading when joining my group, many of
my students become trained instructors, and our campus trains about 150
learners a year in regular Carpentry workshops.  Greg has left an indelible

During the morning coffee break at the first workshop I ever taught with Greg
he was chatting with some of the students who told him they were interested in
seeing reproducible data analysis in action. At the end of the break he tracks
me down and says ``Hey Ethan, can you do a quick demonstration of some data
analysis in an IPython Notebook if I end 30 minutes early?''. I told him I
didn't have anything prepared, but he told me that whatever I pulled together
in the next hour would be fine, and ran off to teach before I could say no. So,
I sat in the back of the room, sketched something out, gave a live demo of it
without practicing, and it was a huge hit.

This experience taught me that I was capable of using live unrehersed coding as
a teaching technique and that it would be a very powerful one in the right
circumstances. I now regularly use this technique in cases where students want
to learn more about something I haven't planned to cover. I would have never
had the confidence to do this without being pushed into it and my students
regularly say that those sections end up being some of the most valuable
portions of the course. I suspect a lot of folks have similar stories of Greg

introduction was in early 2012, when I helped at an early SWC workshop at Utah
State University, and you asked me to consider becoming an instructor. At the
time, I was a field ecologist who wasn‚Äôt very confident in my computational
skills, and I would never have volunteered. But sometimes all we need is
someone to believe in and encourage us. I am forever grateful for your support
in teaching preparation, lesson development, and even sending me a funky sci-fi
book to cheer me up during a particularly stressful and lonely chapter in my
postdoc years. Fast-forward 5 years and I am now poised to begin a tenure-track
faculty position in a brand new Data Analytics program that includes teaching,
research, and designing the curriculum for the first time. I‚Äôve learned a lot
from you and the other Carpenters, without which I probably wouldn‚Äôt have even
applied for this job! But I believe that one of the most important things we
teach is the tools to build on past knowledge and the confidence to try to
build something new. Best wishes for your next adventure, and please keep in
touch :)

The first time I met Greg in person was at a workshop organized in Montreal,
more specifically at CRIM. Today, three jobs later in my career, I happen to be
working at CRIM! I owe Greg so much, career-wise and otherwise. I remember he
made a lasting impression on me in several ways. I will never forget the Shell
lesson taught by Greg that I attended. I found it so naturally pedagogical, so
technically powerful, as well as socially inspiring. Greg showed us we could
pipe ssh with data processing commands, while entertaining us with anecdotes
from his broad work experience, and raising awareness about productivity
fallacies. Greg's generosity cannot be stressed enough. The Carpentries have
provided me with wonderful opportunities for personal and professional growth.
They have provided me with talented friends, challenging projects, and a
supportive network. They are my favourite community, they are my family. We are
leading the way not only in reproducible research, but also in terms of
diversity and inclusivity. It is no overstatement to say that Greg has made the
world a better place.

My first encounter with Greg was actually through the book \title{Beautiful
Code} which he co-edited with Andy Oram of O'Reilly.  It was gifted to my
by my grandfather, who developed code for manufacturing processes on the
Space Shuttle and is one of my biggest influences.  As Greg himself would
probably point out, he's barely in it, and what makes it great is all the
legendary developers who contributed excellent essays to it, but nevermind.
Between having the idea, and an excellent eye for elegant code, Greg had a
big influence on me early in my career through this book (and subsequent
others).

Fast-forward to 2012 (?) and he actually came to my workplace to give a
Software Carpentry ``bootcamp''. I wanted to go, but was sort of busy and
arrogantly figured I knew all the stuff he was teaching anyways.  While I
may have known everything on a technical level (and even that we can't be
sure of), I severely underestimated how much I could have learned both from
his teaching, and all the ancillary details that go into it.

Fortunately my office-mate at the time, Matt Davis, attended.  This was
also around the time Greg was starting to recruit more people to teach SWC
and Matt was interested.  He taught a bootcamp shortly after--had a great
time--and in so doing convinced me to volunteer as well.  Before I knew it
I was teaching Numpy to some 50 grad students and undergrads at Columbia
University.  The value of the opportunities I've had since, both in
learning to teach, the professional and personal connections, and in
personal growth are inestimable.  I always just wish I could do more.

On a personal level too--as evidenced by the testimonials above--Greg is
one of the kindest, most polite (most Canadian, really) people I've ever
met.  As someone starting out my own family, with children on the horizon,
he has been an important positive role model in his open and uninhibited
love of his family.  Thanks Greg.

{\LARGE Technical Details}

The basic template for this book was put together by Eric Jeschke in
2009, as part of a ``Solo Photo Book Month'' project.  The original book
is titled \title{Chickens, Anyone?} and is a lovely recounting of his
family's adventures with raising chickens in their back yard.  The template
was pointed out to me (Erik) by Jonah Duckles, and by complete coincidence
I am personally acquainted with Eric Jeschke, and knowing of his talent I
immediately decided to adopt his work as my template, as he has made it
freely available for copying:

https://redskiesatnight.com/books/pod/latex-templates-for-pod-publishing-with-blurb-com

You'll note that much of the layout of the book was inspired by his book,
so credit where credit is due.

I did what I could with photos taken off the web, and some sent to me by
individual respondents.  Many of them will not be,
perfectionalistically-speaking, `print-quality', but they'll have to do given
that we were short on time.

The book is written using \LaTeX with {\em xetex} and {\em xdvipdfmx} for
easier adjustments for dead tree publishing.  The font used is EB Garamond.
The book was made on Cygwin, and files were tracked in (I'm sorry to say) a
{\em git} repository.  As we were short on time it did not follow many good
software development practices such as reuse or scripting of repetitive tasks
due in part to xkcd\#1319:
