{\LARGE About}
\vspace*{0.25in}

Recently our family got the idea to get some chickens and raise them in
the yard. It's fairly common here on the Big Island of 
Hawaii, which is mostly still a rural, tropical, agricultural kind of
place. We live on the edge of the largest town on the island, Hilo, with
a population of roughly around 40 thousand (40759 in the 2000 census).

Chickens, dogs, wild pigs and cattle can be heard in our neighborhood,
so I wasn't worried that my chickens would disturb anyone. Especially
since I had no intention of getting a rooster. I thought it would be a
fun project for the kids, and maybe we'd get some fresh eggs every week,
to boot. 

This folio was produced as a spin-off from a project to complete a
photography book in one month.  Our ``chicken project'' provided the
back story for the photos in the book.
